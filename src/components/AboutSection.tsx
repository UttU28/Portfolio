            Hello! I'm Utsav, a software developer who loves turning wild ideas into real applications. 
            I have a strong passion for problem-solving and a knack for creating meaningful solutions with code.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed font-handwriting text-2xl">
            Whether it's building an AI-powered home assistant or coding an automation bot to simplify 
            everyday tasks, I thrive on projects that blend innovation with practicality. I approach each 
            new challenge with curiosity, creativity, and a healthy dose of humor â€“ because coding should be fun, right?
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed font-handwriting text-2xl">
            Over the years, I've worn many hats: front-end tinkerer, back-end architect, cloud orchestrator, 
            and even team lead. This journey has taught me how to tackle complex problems with determination and creativity.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed font-handwriting text-2xl">
            I'm the kind of person who sees a bug or an error as just another puzzle to solve 
            (often at 2 AM with a mug of coffee in hand). I take pride in collaborating with others 
            and driving projects forward with clarity and purpose.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed font-handwriting text-2xl">
            In short, I love making tech do things it wasn't originally supposed to do (in a good way), 
            and I'm always excited to learn whatever new tool or language it takes to get the job done.
