# Project Images Directory

Place your project images in this directory with the following filenames to match the code:

1. `apeksha.jpg` - For the Apeksha AI Home Assistant project
2. `linkedin.jpg` - For the LinkedIn Reverse Search project
3. `events.jpg` - For the Event Scraper & CRM project
4. `autogram.jpg` - For the AutoGramBot Instagram automation project
5. `assignmentx.jpg` - For the AssignmentX Handwritten Assignment Generator project
6. `moviecontroller.jpg` - For the Movie Controller Smart Remote project

## Image Guidelines

For best results:
- Use 16:9 aspect ratio images (recommended resolution: 1280x720px or higher)
- Use high-quality images that represent your projects well
- JPG or PNG format works (adjust filenames accordingly if using PNG)
- Aim for file sizes under 500KB for optimal performance

If you don't have actual project screenshots, you can use mockups, relevant stock photos, or generated images that represent the technology or concept behind each project.
